## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- A local server environment (e.g., MAMP, XAMPP, WAMP)
- PHP and MySQL installed
- Access to your WordPress installation

### Installing WordPress
1. **Download WordPress**: Visit the [official WordPress website](https://wordpress.org/download/) and download the latest version.
2. **Unzip WordPress**: Extract the WordPress zip file to your desired location.
3. **Set Up Database**: Using phpMyAdmin (or a similar tool), create a new MySQL database for your WordPress installation.
4. **Run the Installer**: Navigate to your WordPress folder in your web browser (`http://localhost/your-wordpress-folder/`) and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Adding the Template
1. **Download the Template**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. **Copy the Template Folder**: Copy the template folder into the `wp-content/themes/` directory of your WordPress installation. The structure should look like this:

### Activating the Template
1. **Log in to WordPress Admin**: Go to `http://localhost/your-wordpress-folder/wp-admin/` and log in with your credentials.
2. **Navigate to Themes**: In the WordPress dashboard, go to `Appearance` > `Themes`.
3. **Activate the Template**: Find your template in the list and click "Activate."

## Using MAMP (or Similar)

### Installing MAMP
1. **Download MAMP**: Visit the [MAMP website](https://www.mamp.info/en/) and download the latest version for your operating system.
2. **Install MAMP**: Follow the installation instructions provided on the MAMP website.

### Configuring MAMP
1. **Start MAMP**: Open the MAMP application.
2. **Set PHP Version**: Choose the PHP version compatible with your WordPress installation.
3. **Set Document Root**: In MAMP settings, set the document root to the folder where your WordPress files are located.

### Starting Your Local WordPress Site
1. **Start Servers**: Click on "Start Servers" in MAMP.
2. **Access Your Site**: Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost/your-wordpress-folder/` to view your site.

### Alternatives to MAMP
If you prefer using a different local server environment (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, Local by Flywheel), feel free to do so. The setup steps are generally similar, involving the creation of a database and configuring the document root.

## Customization
Once the template is activated, you can start customizing it directly from the WordPress dashboard or by editing the template files in the `wp-content/themes/my-wordpress-template/` directory.
